            "   - **Price Target:** $200.00\n",
            "   - **Rationale:** Apple's diversified product lineup, strong financials, and robust growth prospects in services make it the most attractive investment. The company's brand strength and customer loyalty provide a competitive edge. Despite potential risks like market saturation and supply chain disruptions, Apple's significant cash reserves and history of innovation suggest resilience. The price target reflects confidence in Apple's ability to continue delivering shareholder value.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)**\n",
            "   - **Current Price:** $420.03\n",
            "   - **Price Target:** $460.00\n",
            "   - **Rationale:** Microsoft's strategic investments in AI and cloud computing position it for future growth. The company's financial strength and recurring revenue model offer stability. While cybersecurity concerns and regulatory scrutiny present risks, Microsoft's dominant market position and consistent performance support a positive outlook. The price target accounts for the company's growth potential balanced against the risks.\n",

            "3. **Nvidia Corporation (NVDA)**\n",
            "   - **Current Price:** $903.17\n",
            "   - **Price Target:** $950.00\n",
            "   - **Rationale:** Nvidia's leadership in GPUs and expansion into AI and autonomous vehicles present significant growth opportunities. The company's recent financial performance has been strong. However, geopolitical risks and industry cyclicality warrant caution. The price target is optimistic but conservative, reflecting the balance between Nvidia's growth prospects and potential risks.\n",

            "   - **Rationale:** Amazon's dominance in e-commerce and cloud computing (AWS) underpins its growth prospects. However, legal and regulatory challenges, as well as potential increases in labor costs, introduce uncertainty. The price target suggests a moderate upside, considering the company's market position and innovation capabilities, tempered by the current headwinds.\n",
