            "   - **Rationale:** Apple's robust financial strength, consistent revenue growth, and strong competitive position in the market make it the most attractive investment. The company's ability to innovate and adapt to industry trends, along with its ecosystem and brand loyalty, positions it well for future growth. The risks are present but seem manageable given Apple's track record.\n",

            "   - **Rationale:** Nvidia's financial strength and strategic positioning in high-growth markets such as AI, gaming, and data centers make it an attractive investment. The company's innovation and R&D capabilities provide a competitive edge. Regulatory risks and industry cyclicality are concerns, but long-term growth prospects appear strong.\n",

            "   - **Current Price:** $420.03\n",
            "   - **Price Target:** With Microsoft's solid financials and strategic growth areas, a price target could be a 5-10% increase from the current price, around $441.03 - $462.03.\n",
            "   - **Rationale:** Microsoft's diverse product portfolio and stable cash flow from its cloud and enterprise services are positives. The company's investment in AI and cloud computing are significant growth drivers. However, recent negative sentiment and regulatory risks suggest a cautious approach, hence the 'Hold' recommendation.\n",

            "   - **Rationale:** Amazon's diversified business and leadership in Internet Retail and cloud computing (AWS) are strong points. However, increased operational costs and regulatory pressures present significant risks. The recent court decision and antitrust scrutiny warrant a 'Hold' recommendation and a cautious outlook.\n",

            "   - **Price Target:** Given the current risks and industry competition, a modest price target could be a 5-10% increase from the current price, around $189.48 - $198.51.\n",
            "   - **Rationale:** AMD has potential growth prospects in the semiconductor industry, but it faces significant risks from geopolitical tensions, regulatory changes, and industry cyclicality. The mixed sentiment and analyst ratings leaning towards 'hold' reflect the cautious stance warranted for AMD, making it the least attractive investment among the listed companies.\n",
