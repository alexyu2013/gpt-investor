            "   - **Rationale:** IBM ranks third in attractiveness for investment, driven by its positive stock performance and focus on AI adoption. However, concerns around job displacement, competition, and regulatory challenges pose risks. With a current price of $190.91, IBM's price target could be set at $200, reflecting cautious optimism towards its growth potential in AI adoption and industry growth trends.\n",

            "**Rationale for Ranking:**\n",
            "Microsoft secures the top spot due to its robust position in the cloud market and strategic partnerships, offering strong growth prospects. Apple follows closely behind with its positive outlook and brand strength. IBM, while showing promise in AI adoption, faces more significant challenges that warrant a more cautious approach to investment. The rankings are based on a balance of growth potential, competitive positioning, and risk factors present in each company.\n"
